# Overview

Making this Tic Tac Toe game allowed me to become more familiar with Kotlin. It also gave me the opportunity to become more experienced with using IntelliJ.

The software that I wrote is a 2 player game of tic tac toe. When the program is started up, the terminal displays a tic tac toe board. After the board is displayed,
it prompts each player for a row and column. After a row and column number has been given, it is printed on the tic tac toe board. Whoever is able to get 3 in a row, wins the game.

My main purpose for writing this software was to better understand how Kotlin compares to other programming languages. By making a game of Tic Tac Toe, I was able to see the 
differences in language syntax.

Below is a video demonstration of my tic tac toe program.

# Development Environment

I decided to use IntelliJ as my development environment. The reason that I decided to use IntelliJ is because of how well it is set up to use Kotlin.

The programming language that I used was Kotlin. The only library that I decided to use was a scanner library from Java to get input from the user.

# Future Work

* I need to improve my winning function. If 8 out of the 9 squares are filled, it will call a draw even if it is possible for one of the players to win.
* If a user tries to place a letter in an occuppied spot, it will skip the users' turn. While it doesn't place the letter over the prexisting one, it should prompt the user for 
a different spot.
* When someone wins, it prints out that a winner has been chosen. I could improve this by printing out whether or not "X" or "O" has won.
